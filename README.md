# Module-5-PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the new analysis is to show the total fare prices for each week by city types between January and April.

## Results
Based on the summary_df table below, one can see that the most rides occur in an urban city, second is suburban, and third is rural. The data all shows higher for urban city, with the exception of the average fare per ride and driver. Due to higher volume of rides, it appears the average fare is lower in an urban ciy and also because there are more total drivers of 2,405 compared to 490 drivers in suburban city and 78 drivers in rural city.

Based on the Total Fare by City Type multi-line graph below, one can see that the rural weekly totaled fares are the lowest because there are less rides transactions happening in the rural city. In comparison, urban city has the highest fare amount weekly and suburban is second to urban.

## Summary
Based on the results, I suggest the following three business recommendations to address disparities among city types:
  1. Hire more drivers in the rural city, so the average fare price will go down based on demand and drivers will make similar wages as urban and suburban cities.
  2. Hire less drivers in the urban city, so the average fare price for riders will go up and be similar to rural and suburban cities based on demand. Also, drivers will   earn a similar wage to suburban and rural cities.
  3. Your team should do additional analysis on the number of transactions that occur and understand the timing and seasonal effect on fare prices. For example, do         prices go up near the holidays and down/up in the summer?
